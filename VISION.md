# Overview 
H1k3r is an application designed to take the stress out of hiking with friends and family by making the finding, planning and coordination of hikes **easier**. 
## How is H1k3r different? 
There's a ton of hiking applications out there. You can find hiking apps that will track your hike and provide numerous statistics for analysis, there are fantastic applications for searching and finding trails, and there are applications that keep you safe on the trails with information and communication, but none of them address what I believe is the most difficult part of hiking - getting all your friends/family on the same page. 

### Let me illustrate this with a story: 
> Suzie wants to go for a hike with Jane, Alex, Aaron and Emily. Suzie texts Aaron, who asks something about Emily, in turn requiring Suzie to message Emily again, wait for the response and relay it back to Aaron, then to Alex and Jane to keep them informed. They've been talking about doing it for months, but never seem to get all the pieces together. 
> Fed up with texting each of them, and even trying group chats; Suzie turns to H1k3r.  She creates an "event" which she calls "Besties hit the trails", and selects an availability window (e.g. Wednesday from 8am through Sunday at 5pm), and then sends "invitations" to all her Jane, Alex, Aaron and Emily with an expiration date of Monday (two days before the availability window starts). She then adds 3 hikes that she has been dying to check out, and adds them to the "event" as options. She votes for "Bruce Speer Creek Trail" because Suzie's been dying to check that one out. 
> Upon recieving the "invitation"; Jane, Alex, Aaron and Emily fill out there "busy" time indicating the times that do **not** work for each of them. Since Suzie is the organizer of this hike or "event", Suzie is the only person that will be able to see their individual responses. They also will have an opportunity to suggest other hikes (visible to all attendees) and vote on the one's that are most of interest to them (all individuals can see the number of votes for each location, but only the organizer can see who voted for which location). 
> At expiration (or sooner if Suzie's friends are prompt), Suzie (the "event organizer") can see who votes for which locations/trails and who has availability to go for a hike, how long each person is available and at what time. 
## Pain Points 
Ever struggle with..
- Getting everyone on board for the same location/trail? 
  - conflict about how long or difficult a trail is 
  - conflict about which trails will provide the best views 
  - conflict about how long someone wants to spend hiking 
- Finding a time that works for everyone
  - busy schedules make it difficult for everyone to attend 
  - may have to split the hike into different parties or meet part-way through 
- Keeping everyone up-to-date 
  - Coordination of supplies (i.e. Jared is bringing 10 water bottles, Alex has trail mix to share) 
  - Coordinate drivers 
  - Sharing parking location 
  - Setting meet time/location 
### Selecting a Hike and a time 
There are SOOOOO many different types of hikes out there. If you don't believe me then the internet is here to prove you wrong; as of the time of this writing, [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/) has cataloged **over** 100,000 trails. Other projects like the [The Hiking Project](https://www.hikingproject.com/) have cataloged **over** 200,000 trails (_**at the time of this writing_), and those are just a few examples. 

These services allow you to search and filter hikes like we never would have imagined 20 years ago, providing real-time information on (and by no means is this a exhaustive list): 
- Features of the trails (waterfalls, rivers, rapids, canyon, etc.)
- The type of trail (out-and-back, loop, etc.)
- The change in elevation (start, min, max, overall change, etc.)
- Animal information ( dogs allowed, leash-required, etc.)
- Descriptions of the trails 
- Recomendations on how best to get there, proper attire, and more. 
- Photos of along the hike 

While the informaiton is out there, it is scattered among different sources and doesn't really embrace social planning - that's where H1k3r comes in. 

H1ker seeks to consolidate data from amazing third party organizations like [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/), and [The Hiking Project](https://www.hikingproject.com/), and make it easy for people to decide on "the one" (or the many "ones"). H1k3r does this by allowing someone to become an "event organizer". There are two important vocabulary words we need to elaborate on before we proceed further: 

In H1k3r, an _"event"_ refers to a planned excursion to a trail or park, and an _"organizer"_ refers to the person administrating or planning the event. As such an "event organizer" is the administrator or planner of an excursion to a park or trail.  

Let's review how we would do this **without** H1k3r, imagine the following: 
1. Suzie texts Alex, Jane and Rob to see if they want to go hiking 
2. Alex and Jane say that they do, Rob doesn't reply
3. Since Rob hasn't replied, Suzie texts Eddie to see if he is interested. 
4. While waiting on a response from Eddie, Suzie asks Jane and Alex when they are free to go hiking 
5. Alex says he is available on the 15th, 18th, 23rd or 25th 
6. Jane says she is available on any Friday for the rest of the month. 
7. Eddie response to Suzie and asks; 'when would you like to go hiking?' 
8. Since Suzie is still figuring out the "when", Suzie creates a group on Facebook (T) and adds all her friends, and then works on getting them all on the same page. 
9. Jane shares a link to a hike from this blog she was reading that she wants to check out. 
10. Eddie says he is looking for a hike that wouldn't take as long. 

...the back-and-forth continues...

This is the main problem H1k3r is trying to address: 

H1k3r thinks planning should be simplier and involve less messages to relay simple availability. With H1k3r, any user can create an "event". Whoever creates this event becomes the "organizer" (think administrator) of the event - they have the ultimate control over the event. 

At creation, the event organizer will enter a date range and invite anyone they want to go come hiking. Once saved, these invitations will be sent to the event attendees. Similar to snail-mail RSVP invitations, invites sent from H1k3r will have an expiration, after which responses will not be accepted (hopefully motivating your fellow h1k3rs to respond quickly). This RSVP will include a a date range (e.g. Wednesday at 8am through Sunday at 5pm) indicating a timeframe in which the organizer of the "event" (excursion to park, hike, or other outdoor adventure) is looking to get together to get outside with other H1k3rs. 

Invitees will be asked to respond to the invitation by removing from the event "window" (timeframe) times that work for them. Invitees availability will default to unavailable during the entire window by default - indicating that the "invitee" is unavailable during the entire window of availability. Recall, "invitees" will have a set timeframe during which they can respond, after which their availability will be "locked" (unable to be changed). It is also during the RSVP period, that "invitees" will be able to vote on or suggests destinations for the event. 

Once all the invited h1k3rs have responded with their availability (or lack there of), the organizer can get a good idea of what time works for the most people. Since this information is **only** visible to the "event organizer" there should be no bias in responses from the "invitees" (e.g. _"I'll just put the same availability as Sarah"_).
